``typical`` JSON Schema API
===========================
This documentation is provided for API completion, but you should not generally find
yourself in a place where you must define your JSON schema manually. The recommended
path for getting a JSON schema is using the ``typic.schema()`` and ``typic.schemas``
functions.
